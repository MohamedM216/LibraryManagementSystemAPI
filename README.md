<h2>📚 Library Management System API</h2>

LibraryManagementSystemAPI is a C# ASP.NET Core backend API for managing book borrowing with JWT authentication, role-based authorization, and Stripe payment integration. This system enables authors to manage their books and members to borrow and return books. It also includes automated email notifications and background services for handling overdue returns and payment reconciliation.

<h2>🌟 Features</h2>

JWT Authentication, Refresh JWT Tokens & Role-Based Authorization:
    Authors and members have different roles and permissions.

Book Management (Authors):
    Add, update, and delete books.

Borrowing and Payment Process (Members):
    Borrow a book and pay via Stripe.
    Revenue split: 80% for the platform, 20% for the author.
    Automated handling of failed author Stripe accounts with background reconciliation.

Overdue Return Handling:
    If a book is not returned within 30 days, a late fee is applied, and an email notification is sent.

Background Services:
    Monitor overdue books and apply fees.
    Handle failed Stripe account payments for authors.

Email Notifications:
    Welcome emails for new members and authors.
    Detailed emails for both authors and members regarding borrowing transactions.

Logging:
    Logs critical events and system activities.
